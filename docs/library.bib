abstract = {Data collection at ultra high-frequency on financial markets requires the manipulation of complex databases, and possibly the correction of errors present in the data. The New York Stock Exchange is chosen to provide evidence of problems affecting ultra high-frequency data sets. Standard filters can be applied to remove bad records from the trades and quotes data. A method for outlier detection is proposed to remove data which do not correspond to plausible market activity. Several methods of aggregation of the data are suggested, according to which corresponding time series of interest for econometric analysis can be constructed. As an example of the relevance of the procedure, the autoregressive conditional duration model is estimated on price durations. Failure to purge the data from "wrong" ticks is likely to shorten the financial durations between substantial price movements and to alter the autocorrelation profile of the series. The estimated coefficients and overall model diagnostics are considerably altered in the absence of appropriate steps in data cleaning. Overall the difference in the coefficients is bigger between the dirty series and the clean series than among series filtered with different algorithms.},

Research results using high frequency data and analytics are described, and directions for future development are discussed.Currently the key mechanism for preventing catastrophic market action are “circuit breakers.” We believe a more graduated approach, similar to the “yellow light” approach in motorsports to slow down traffic, might be a better way to achieve the same goal. To enable this objective, we study a number of indicators that could foresee hazards in market conditions and explore options to confirm such predictions.Our tests confirm that Volume Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) and a version of volume Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for measuring market fragmentation can indeed give strong signals ahead of the Flash Crash event on May 6, 2010. This is a preliminary step toward a full-fledged early-warning system for unusual market conditions.},

We examine the accuracy of three methods for classifying trade data: bulk volume classification (BVC), Tick Rule and Aggregated Tick Rule. We develop a Bayesian model of inferring information from trade executions, and show the conditions in which tick rules or bulk volume classification will predominate.Empirically, we find that Tick rule approaches and BVC are relatively good classifiers of the aggressor side of trading, but bulk volume classifications are better linked to proxies of information-based trading. Thus, BVC would appear to be a useful tool for discerning trading intentions from market data.},

abstract = {Ten actinomycete strains that form chains of spiral or looped spores were isolated from the soil and dung samples in Japan. They contained D- and L-lysine, meso-A(2)pm, D-glutamic acid, D- and L-alanine in cell wall peptidoglycan; madurose as a characteristic whole-cell sugar; MK-9(H(6)) and MK-9(H(8)) as the major isoprenoid quinones; iso-C(16:0) as the predominant cellular fatty acid; and 69-74 mol\% G+C content in the genomic DNA. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolated actinomycete strains consistently formed a monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix and a separate line of descent in the phylogenetic cluster of the family Thermomonosporaceae. Actinomadura spadix also contained D- and L-lysine in addition to meso-A(2)pm. These genetic and phenotypic evidences revealed that the actinomycete strains could be clearly differentiated from the other members of the family Thermomonosporaceae and that they warranted a separate genus status. We concluded that Actinomadura spadix should be assigned the status of the type species of a new genus Actinoallomurus and referred to as Actinoallomurus spadix comb. nov.

@article{Yan2009,
abstract = {In spite of the many successful applications of the concept of probability of information-based trading (PIN), the method used for its estimation (Easley et al., 1996) suffers several serious shortcomings. 1) It fails to deliver the PIN to a huge number of stocks. Using the most widely cited PIN estimates posted by Havidkjaer as an example, the joint market share of stocks with valid PIN estimates is only 52\% of the entire market in 2001. The current trend is even worse because the steady increase of trading activities increases the failure rate. 2) It assumes that trading days or event days are independent, which is refutable. In this paper, a new method is developed to correct these problems. For example, the assumption of independence is discarded. The new method is designed to deliver PINs to all stocks. In contrast to the current method, the performance of the new method is an increasing function of the trading activities. After comparing the proposed new PINs with those in Easley et al. (1996) and Havidkjaer, many interesting findings are derived, which are presented here.},

@article{Andersen2014,
abstract = {In Andersen and Bondarenko (2014), using tick data for S\&P 500 futures, we establish that the VPIN metric of Easley, L\'{o}pez de Prado, and O'Hara (ELO), by construction, will be correlated with trading volume and return volatility (innovations). Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO (2011a, 2012a). At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN. In fact, using perfect classification leads to diametrically opposite results relative to ELO (2011a, 2012a). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {VPIN (Volume synchronized Probability of Informed trading) is a leading indicator of liquidity-induced volatility. It is best known for having produced a signal more than hours before the Flash Crash of 2010. On that day, the market saw the biggest one-day point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which culminated to the market value of \$1 trillion disappearing, but only to recover those losses twenty minutes later (Lauricella 2010). The computation of VPIN requires the user to set up a handful of free parameters. The values of these parameters significantly affect the effectiveness of VPIN as measured by the false positive rate (FPR). An earlier publication reported that a brute-force search of simple parameter combinations yielded a number of parameter combinations with FPR of 7\%. This work is a systematic attempt to find an optimal parameter set using an optimization package, NOMAD (Nonlinear Optimization by Mesh Adaptive Direct Search) by Audet, le digabel, and tribes (2009) and le digabel (2011). We have implemented a number of techniques to reduce the computation time with NOMAD. Tests show that we can reduce the FPR to only 2\%. To better understand the parameter choices, we have conducted a series of sensitivity analysis via uncertainty quantification on the parameter spaces using UQTK (Uncertainty Quantification Toolkit). Results have shown dominance of 2 parameters in the computation of FPR. Using the outputs from NOMAD optimization and sensitivity analysis, We recommend A range of values for each of the free parameters that perform well on a large set of futures trading records.},

Most previously suggested approaches to this problem are either somewhat ad hoc or require parametric assumptions and complicated calculations. In this paper we develop a simple yet powerful non-parametric method for choosing the number of clusters based on distortion, a quantity that measures the average distance, per dimension, between each observation and its closest cluster center. Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world data sets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems.},

We present a new procedure to estimate flow toxicity based on volume imbalance and trade intensity (the VPIN toxicity metric). VPIN is updated in volume time, making it applicable to the high-frequency world, and it does not require the intermediate estimation of non-observable parameters or the application of numerical methods. It does require trades classified as buys or sells, and we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that we argue is more useful in high-frequency markets than standard classification procedures.We show that the VPIN metric is a useful indicator of short-term, toxicity-induced volatility},

abstract = {The Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed trading (VPIN) metric is introduced by Easley, L\'{o}pez de Prado, and O'Hara (2011a) as a real-time indicator of order flow toxicity. They find the measure useful in monitoring order flow imbalances and conclude that it may help signal impending market turmoil, exemplified by historical high readings of the metric prior to the flash crash. More generally, they show that VPIN is significantly correlated with future short-term return volatility. In contrast, our empirical investigation of VPIN documents that it is a poor predictor of short run volatility, that it did not reach an all-time high prior, but rather after, the flash crash, and that its predictive content is due primarily to a mechanical relation with the underlying trading intensity. Preliminary experimentation suggests that signed order flow indicators may contain useful information for gauging real-time market stress indicators. Nonetheless, we caution against the adoption of any specific metric until its performance has been compared thoroughly to suitable benchmarks, including the type of analysis we undertake in this paper. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Extensive simulation demonstrates that the approach can successfully identify market states and generate dynamic measures of information-based trading that outperform prevailing models.  A sample of 120 NYSE stocks further verifies that it can better depict trading dynamics.  With this sample, we characterize the features of information asymmetry and belief dispersion around earnings announcements.  The sample is also applied to the study of the co-movements of trading activities due to private information or disputable public information.},

abstract = {We investigate the role of information-based trading in affecting asset returns. We show in a rational expectation example how private information affects equilibrium asset returns. Using a market microstructure model, we derive a measure of the probability of information-based trading, and we estimate this measure using data for individual NYSE-listed stocks for 1983 to 1998. We then incorporate our estimates into a Fama and French (1992) asset-pricing framework. Our main result is that information does affect asset prices. A difference of 10 percentage points in the probability of information-based trading between two stocks leads to a difference in their expected returns of 2.5 percent per year.

It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out computations for parameter estimation, model selection and checking, decoding, and forecasting. Illustrates the methodology in actionAfter presenting the simple Poisson HMM, the book covers estimation, forecasting, decoding, prediction, model selection, and Bayesian inference. Through examples and applications, the authors describe how to extend and generalize the basic model so it can be applied in a rich variety of situations. They also provide R code for some of the examples, enabling the use of the codes in similar applications. Effectively interpret data using HMMs This book illustrates the wonderful flexibility of HMMs as general-purpose models for time series data. It provides a broad understanding of the models and their uses.},

Although BVC leads to impressive (more than 99\%) time savings when applied to pre-compressed data, this efficiency comes at a significant (7.4\% to 16.3\%) loss of accuracy. Users of conventional trade data such as TAQ only save about 5\% of processing time by choosing BVC over TR. In addition, TR produces more accurate estimates of order imbalances and of order flow toxicity (VPIN).},

abstract = {We propose a dynamic econometric microstructure model of trading, and we investigate how the dynamics of trades and trade composition interact with the evolution of market liquidity, market depth, and order flow. We estimate a bivariate generalized autoregressive intensity process for the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades for 16 actively traded stocks over 15 years of transaction data. Our results show that both informed and uninformed trades are highly persistent, but that the uninformed arrival forecasts respond negatively to past forecasts of the informed intensity. Our estimation generates daily conditional arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades, which we use to construct forecasts of the probability of information-based trade (PIN). These forecasts are used in turn to forecast market liquidity as measured by bid-ask spreads and the price impact of orders. We observe that PINs vary across assets and over time, and most importantly that they are correlated across assets. Our analysis shows that one principal component explains much of the daily variation in PINs and that this systemic liquidity factor may be important for asset pricing. We also find that PINs tend to rise before earnings announcement days and decline afterwards.},

Flow toxicity can be expressed by the Probability of Informed Trading (PIN). We present a new procedure to estimate the Probability of Informed Trading based on volume imbalance and trade intensity (the VPIN* informed trading metric). An important advantage of the VPIN metric over previous estimation procedures is that it does not require the intermediate estimation of non-observable parameters describing the order flow or the application of numerical methods. An additional advantage is that VPIN is updated in volume- time, rather than clock-time, which improves its predictive power in a high frequency world. Monte Carlo experiments show that our estimate is accurate for all theoretically possible combinations of parameters. Finally, we show that the VPIN metric predicts short-term, toxicity-induced volatility.},
