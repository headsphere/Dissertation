##Problem Background

Outline of VPIN and what it is trying to resolve. 

Explain economic justification for VPIN

Outline algorithm for computing VPIN (http://rof.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2014/09/25/rfu041.DC1/Web_appedix.pdf) 

Brief outline of controversy

##Work to Date

Literature review

Data cleansing and preparation

##Plan for Remaining Work

Simulation Study

- Write code to generate VPIN metric from simulated trade data 

- Parameter inference via Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Expectation-Maximisation (EM) [JUSTIFY THIS APPROACH]

Empirical data analysis

- Test predictive power with known market crashes e.g flash crash
