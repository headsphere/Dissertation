##Problem Background

###Outline of VPIN and what it is trying to resolve. 

VPIN is an extension of the PIN model developed by O'Hara and Easley used to identify the probability of information based trading. That is if one is a non-informed participant such as a market-maker, what is the probability that you are dealing with an informed trader, and hence become subject to adverse selection. This is a critical metric for market makers as it enables them to set appropriate bid-ask prices such that the spread compensates them for the probability of dealing with an insider.

For this reason PIN has been used as a metric to measure the extent of so-called order-flow toxicity. As toxicity increases spreads will widen, thereby reducing liquidity provisioning. To the extreme, this can cause markets to completely fail. An example of this is the famous 2010 Flash Crash  

Explain economic justification for VPIN

Brief outline of controversy

##Work to Date

Literature review

Data cleansing and preparation

##Plan for Remaining Work

Simulation Study

- Write code to generate VPIN metric from simulated trade data 

- Parameter inference via Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Expectation-Maximisation (EM) [JUSTIFY THIS APPROACH]

Empirical data analysis

- Test predictive power with known market crashes e.g flash crash
