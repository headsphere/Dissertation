The unobserved efficient prices ($m_t$) follow the dynamics:
 
$m_t = m_{t-1} + w_t$

$w_t = \lambda q_t + u_t$

$q_t$ is in indicator variable indicating where it was a buy (1) or a sell (0)

$\lambda q_t$ reflects the information content of the trade at time $t$. Can be considered as the cost of adverse selection

The observed trade prices ($p_t$) follow the model:

$p_t = m_t + cq_t$

$c$ reflects the dealer's costs

Trade prices can be simluated as follows:

```{r}

nObs = 10000
c = 1
lambda = 2
sdu = 1

m = as.numeric()
q = as.numeric()
u = as.numeric()
p = as.numeric()
t = as.numeric()

for (i in 1:nObs)
  {
  q[i] = sign(rnorm(1))
  u[i] = rnorm(1, sd = sdu)
  m[i] = ifelse(i == 1, 0, m[i-1]) + lambda * q[i] + u[i]
  p[i] = m[i] + c * q[i]
  t[i] = i
  }

df = data.frame(m, t, q, u, p)
head(df)

plot(p)
```
